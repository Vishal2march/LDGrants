  <h4>Prequalification Requirement</h4>
  
  
  <%--1/7/16 these are old prequal instructions; below are new ones as of guidelines doc 16-17
  <p>
  The State of New York has implemented a new statewide prequalification process designed to facilitate prompt 
  contracting for not-for-profit vendors. All not-for-profit vendors are required to prequalify prior to grant 
  application. Interested vendors are asked to submit commonly requested documents, and answer frequently 
  asked questions once. The application requests organizational information about the vendor’s capacity, 
  legal compliance, and integrity. To learn more about prequalification, go to the Grants Reform website 
  <a href="http://www.grantsreform.ny.gov/Grantees" target="_blank">(http://www.grantsreform.ny.gov/Grantees)</a> 
  where you can preview the questions and required documents. 
  <br/><br/>
  More information can also be found in the Conservation/Preservation Discretionary 
  <a href="docs/guidelinesDiscretionary.doc" target="_blank">Guidelines</a> (MS Word)</p>
  
  <br/><br/>
  
  <p>Following is a summary of the steps that must be undertaken in order for you to prequalify. </p>
  <br/>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Go to the Grants Reform website 
  <a href="http://www.grantsreform.ny.gov/Grantees" target="_blank">(http://www.grantsreform.ny.gov/Grantees)</a>
  and download a copy of the 
  Registration Form. Please review the instructions for submission of this Form. The form must be signed by an 
  authorized representative of your organization and notarized, and must be sent to the Division of Budget as 
  soon as possible in order to gain access to the Grants Gateway to enable prequalification.</li>
  
  <li>Upon submission of your Registration Form, you will be provided with a User ID allowing you to gain access 
  to the Gateway. From there, please logon to the Gateway System 
  <a href="https://grantsgateway.ny.gov/IntelliGrants_NYSGG/login2.aspx" target="_blank">(https://grantsgateway.ny.gov/IntelliGrants_NYSGG/login2.aspx)</a> 
  and begin your Prequalification Application.</li>
  
  <li>Vendors who already submitted registration materials and received their user credentials can begin to 
  upload documents into the Document Vault and complete their online Prequalification Questionnaire. </li>
  
  <li>As you fill out the Questionnaire, please refer to the Gateway Training Materials and resource links 
  posted on the “grantees” section of the Grants Reform website to help you navigate the questionnaire. If you 
  still have questions, simply contact your State agency program contact, or post your question 
  to GrantsReform@Budget.ny.gov, and someone will get back to you quickly with a response.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <br/><br/>
  <p>
  If you have any questions about prequalification registration, please go to the Grants Reform website or 
  contact your State Agency Representative at prequal@nysed.gov.  In order to be eligible to apply for 
  an award under this grant, any not for-profit entity must pre-qualify using the Grants Gateway. No paperwork 
  is required to be sent as proof of application; however, agencies that have not been pre-qualified by 
  application due date; will not be considered for a grant award. 
  
  <b>As this process may take up to a few weeks, 
  it is advised that interested agencies begin this process immediately upon RFP announcement.</b></p>
