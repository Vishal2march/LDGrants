New for C/P Discretionary Proposals:  Prequalification Requirement, and M/WBE Policy.

The State of New York has implemented a new statewide prequalification process 
(described in http://www.grantsreform.ny.gov/Grantees) designed to facilitate prompt contracting for not-for-profit vendors. 
All not-for-profit vendors are required to pre-qualify prior to the due date of grant application.  

All applicants applying for grants in excess of $25,000 are required to comply with NYSED’s Minority and Women-Owned
Business Enterprises (M/WBE) policy.
