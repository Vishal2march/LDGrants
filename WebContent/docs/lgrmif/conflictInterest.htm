><FONT size="+1"> The State Archives has an obligation to ensure that the review of applications for grants under the New York State Local Government Records Management Improvement Fund is both fair and objective.  To achieve these ends it is essential that any reviewer who has a connection to an applicant or might benefit directly or indirectly from a grant be excluded from the review of associated applications.  Even the appearance of a conflict of interest must be avoided.  Consequently, we have developed this conflict of interest statement, which applies to members of the Local Government Records Advisory Council as well as to outside reviewers.  Please review the review requirements described below, and then indicate in the following space the log numbers of any applications that might pose a conflict of interest to you.  Then, sign and date this document and return it via email to archgrants@mail.nysed.gov.  If you have any questions about this statement, or wish to discuss any application where you may have a conflict, please call the Grants Administration Unit at 518-474-6926. </P
