Conservation/Preservation Coordinated Grant Contracts</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Before you begin
your evaluations, you should read the <b>Conservation/ Preservation Coordinated
Preservation Grant Program Guidelines </b>document carefully.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Two independent
conservators, archivists or preservation administrators are being asked to
review each proposal. Since conservation/ preservation is a small field and it
is difficult (often impossible) to assemble a panel of competent people who have
no contact with the applicants, the question of &quot;conflict of
interest&quot; may arise as you look over the applications. If you feel that
you cannot be impartial about a proposal, please contact me immediately so we
can decide if we need to send the proposal to another reviewer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>The grant review
form will explain how you are to rate the various sections of the proposals. 
You will rate the individual components of the project.  Once we have tabulated
the three reviewers' (including program staff) ratings, the proposals are
ranked, based on composite scores. You may complete the rating form online and submit
the evaluation through the Division of Library Development Online Grant System.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>You are strongly
encouraged to make narrative comments on each proposal. Narrative comments have
proved to be very helpful in responding to applicants' requests for information
about how their proposals were reviewed, and how future applications might be
improved.  Your comments may be as expansive as time will allow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>As those of you
who have been reviewers in the past know, application and review procedures
have evolved considerably.  To help us make further improvements, you are
encouraged to comment on the program, the application and review process, and
any issues that may require a change in policy or should be addressed in the
guidelines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>If you need help
with the review procedure or in interpreting the guidelines, please feel free
to call me.  Our number is (518) 474-7890.  Thanks very much for agreeing to
participate in this year's review.  I appreciate your contribution of time and
expertise and hope that you will find the process interesting and useful.</p>
